            <h1>LUKE DARLING</h1>
            <h2>Dual Enrolled Student in Greer, South Carolina</h2>

            <p>
                Hello, everyone. I am an 18-year-old homeschooled highschool senior taking classes dually enrolled at Bob Jones University.
                I live in Greer, SC and commute each day like a day student would.
                This is my fourth and final semester as a dual enrolled student, and I have already been accepted to BJU as a freshman for Fall of 2018.
                I plan to move into a dorm and live on campus this Fall, despite living within driving distance of the university.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>PROGRAMMING</h3>
            <p>
                My interest in programming began at the age of 8 years old. I was very fascinated by computers,
                and decided I wanted to learn to make a pop up box appear and say whatever I wanted it to. This led to me checking out programming books
                from the library until I learned some Visual Basic Script and made my young heart excited to have written my first program. I quickly began
                studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and creating basic web pages on my computer. By age 10, I started learning PHP and using it on an XAMPP
                server I installed on my Windows XP desktop to experiment with interactive and dynamic web experiences. At age 12, I installed my first copy of Ubuntu Linux
                and never looked back at Windows. In the meantime, I started developing plugins for Minecraft: Pocket Edition servers written in PHP around age 13
                and became a very highly acclaimed developer in their communities. Around age 14 I enjoyed getting into C and C++ development with Arduinos. I have
                since furthered my self-grown development skills to almost fully
                professional levels, having designed several applications for private companies. At age 16, I took my first formal programming class, CpS 109, here at BJU,
                which I excelled at despite doubts from my professor and academic advisors due to my young age; I even commonly stayed after class to help the other students
                with their programs.<br/>
                <br />
                Here I am today in CpS 110, excited to be learning lots more about the Python language I've dabbled in previously. I can't wait to see what God
                reveals to me about myself and my future through this class.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>WORK</h3>
            <p>
                I work part-time for Bob Jones University as a technician with the Campus Audio/Visual department.
                I help to maintain the projector fleet, maintain the security cameras on campus, pull cable for A/V and network feeds,
                handle some IT duties such as managing the network racks, and many other things.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>CHURCH</h3>
            <p>
                I've gone to Emmanuel Baptist Church of Greer, SC since I was little. I love God and I love my church family.
                I have served at my church for several years. I run the sound room during church services, weddings, funerals,
                and any other events I may be needed for. I designed and installed a WiFi mesh network for my church in 2016.
                I manage my church's social media presence and I created a website for us when I was 13 years old, and although I'm very busy with work and school now,
                I still try to maintain it as best as I can.<br />
