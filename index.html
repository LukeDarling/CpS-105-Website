            <h1>LUKE DARLING</h1>
            <h2>Computer Science Sophomore in Greer, South Carolina</h2>

            <p>
                Hello, everyone. I am a 19-year-old student at Bob Jones University who lives in Greer, SC during the Summer and the dorms during the school year. I enjoy programming, reading the Bible as well as fiction, and spending time with my friends.
            </p>

            <h3>PROGRAMMING</h3>
            <p>
                My interest in programming began at the age of 8 years old. I was very fascinated by computers,
                and decided I wanted to learn to make a pop up box appear and say whatever I wanted it to. This led to me checking out programming books
                from the library until I learned some Visual Basic Script and made my young heart excited to have written my first program. I quickly began
                studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and creating basic web pages on my computer. By age 10, I started learning PHP and using it on an XAMPP
                server I installed on my Windows XP desktop to experiment with interactive and dynamic web experiences. At age 12, I installed my first copy of Ubuntu Linux
                and never looked back at Windows. In the meantime, I started developing plugins for Minecraft: Pocket Edition servers written in PHP around age 13
                and became a highly acclaimed developer in their communities. Around age 14 I enjoyed getting into C++ development with Arduinos. I have
                since furthered my self-grown development skills to
                professional levels, having designed several applications for private companies. At age 16, I took my first formal programming class, CpS 109, here at BJU,
                which I excelled at despite doubts from my professor and academic advisors due to my young age; I even commonly stayed after class to help the other students
                with their programs.
                I have since taken CpS 110, CpS 230, CpS 320, and CpS 335.<br/>
                <br />
                Here I am today in CpS 105. Despite trying to get Dr. Knisely to let me skip this class for the last 2 years, I'm actually glad I'm taking it now. I find From the Garden to the City to be very intriguing and thought provoking
            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>WORK</h3>
            <p>
                I work for Bob Jones University as an A/V Technician with the Campus Audio/Visual department of Facilities Management.
                I help to maintain the projector fleet, maintain the security cameras on campus, pull cable for A/V and network feeds,
                handle some IT duties such as managing the network racks, and many other things. I am also primarily responsible for programming all the A/V control systems on campus, including my project last Summer when I saved the university thousands of dollars a year by switching Stratton Hall from a system maintained proprietarily by contractors to a system I could legally program myself, Extron.

            <h3>CHURCH</h3>
            <p>
                I've gone to Emmanuel Baptist Church of Greer, SC since I was very little. I love God and I love my church family.
                I have served at my church for several years. I run the sound room during church services, weddings, funerals,
                and any other events I may be needed for. I designed and installed a WiFi mesh network for my church in 2016.
                I manage my church's social media presence and I created a website for us when I was 13 years old, and although I'm very busy with work and school now,
                I still try to maintain it as best as I can.<br />
